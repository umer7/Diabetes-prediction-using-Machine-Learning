# Diabetes-prediction-using-Machine-Learning

# Data set
The `diabetes` dataset consists of 10 physiological variables (age, sex, weight, blood pressure) measure on 442 patients, and an indication of disease progression after one year:


# Machine Learning Technique
As the data is numeric so Linear Regression is used

# Working
In order to illustrate a two-dimensional plot of this regression technique. The straight line can be seen in the plot, showing how linear regression attempts to draw a straight line that will best minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed responses in the dataset, and the responses predicted by the linear approximation.
The coefficients, the residual sum of squares and the variance score are also
calculated.
